# multilingual_FN
A home for collaboration on construction of a multilingual FrameNet.

This repository is intended for collaboration on Multilingual FrameNet among researchers working on FrameNets for various languages around the world.  There are two main projects at this time:

1. The collection of data from all the languages in a database designed to facilitate comparative studies in Frame Semantics.  The questions to be researched include: To what extent are the frames developed in the first FrameNet project for English applicable to other languages?  What sorts of differences in semantic frames are found between languages, and to what extent are they systematic?  Do such comparisons illuminate previously noted cross language differences?  Do they highlight differences that have not been investigated previously?

2. A parallel annotation project, in which parallel texts in all the FrameNet languages will be annotated, and the annotations compared.  Until now, each FrameNet project has been choosing its own texts to annotate, so comparisons have been made more difficult due to differences in genre and basic content.  For this project, we have chosen two texts, the transcripts of the TED talk "Do schools kill creativity?" by Ken Robinson in each language, and a portion of the Wikipedia article on "Solar System" from each language.   The TED talk transcripts are very closely parallel across languages, although the Wikipedia articles differ in length and style.
